# CS4280-Compiler
Compiler Repository
This program is a compiler that I created for CS4280. This program will take any text file with 
a .fs182 extention and turn it into a .asm file. This assembly language can then be executed 
using Dr. Janikow's virtual Machine called VirtMach. Each section of the compiler was created
in separate projects which I have included in this repository.
