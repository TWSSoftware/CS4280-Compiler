This program successfully takes tokens from a scanner and creates a tree. The tree is
then read by the testTree program, which prints the tree using preorder traversal. 
The results of the testTree program is in tree.data. The program can detect if there
is an error, gives the incorrect token and line number it resides in, lists the token
or tokens it was looking for, and aborts the program.
