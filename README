This program takes a file from the command line or from standard input, transforms 
every character to the lowercase form of the character, and creates a tree from the 
fileput or standard input. This program also prints the inorder, preorder, and 
postorder traversals to their respective file created in the users folder. 

This program also has the option of taking in user input as a file. This option is
activated by running the program without an argument or sending in a file as standard
input. Once it is activate the user can type in anything they want. Once they are
done typing in the input; they can press enter and then control d to signal an End of
File to the program and run the rest of the program. 

For both sending a file by standard input or using input from the user, the project 
will create a file to write the standard input to and it removes the file after the
program finished running. 

Lastly, there is a make command, make clear, that will remove all the output files.
