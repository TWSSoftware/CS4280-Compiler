This program is a compiler that I created for CS4280. This program will take any .fs182 file 
and turn it into a .asm file. This assembly language can then be executed using Dr. Janikow's
virtual Machine called VirtMach. Each section of the compiler was created in separate projects 
which I have included in this repository.
