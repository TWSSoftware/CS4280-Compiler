# CS4280-Compiler
Compiler Repository
This program is a compiler that I created for CS4280. This program will take any text file with 
a .fs182 extention and turn it into a .asm file. This assembly language can then be executed 
using Dr. Janikow's virtual Machine called VirtMach. Each section of the compiler was created
in separate projects which I have included in this repository. The Master branch contains the 
final project, test local file, and the compiled version of the test local file. The test local
filed showed that the compiler incorperates the variable's scope.
