This program checks the static semantics for a file. The static semantics for this
project included the proper use for the variables. It checked if the scope for a variable
is global or local. If the variable is a local variable then the program will check if the 
variable has already been declared in the scope. The static semantics stated that the 
variable is global if it is declared outside the main block and local if it is declared 
inside a block. Global variables are able to be used anywhere within the program and the 
local variables are only available within its block. Local variables in the same scope cannot 
share the same name and the closes variable to the scope takes precedence over the other 
variables with the same name. It is invoked by statSem [file] where file has the same 
extensions as the previous projects for this compiler.
